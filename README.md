Card Matching Game

This project is a card matching game designed to test and enhance memory skills. The game layout includes a grid of cards that users can flip to find matching pairs.

Features:
Memory Game Layout: A grid of cards with a flip effect when clicked, providing a dynamic and engaging user experience.
Reset Button: A button to restart the game, refreshing the card layout and allowing users to play again.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Defines the structure of the game, including the layout and game controls.
CSS: Styles the game interface with a flexible grid layout, flip animations for cards, and a responsive design.
How It Works:
Card Flip Effect: Cards flip to reveal their faces, and users try to match pairs. Correct matches stay open, while unmatched cards flip back.
Reset Function: Clicking the reset button reloads the page, resetting the game to its initial state.
This project demonstrates the use of CSS animations and layout techniques to create an interactive and fun memory game.
